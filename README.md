# Remote Execute
RemoteExecute is a tool similar to Azure Automation. It allows define and execute long running tasks for cloud environment. Both help IT Pro's save time by automating routine tasks. The difference is that Azure Automation is limited to PowerShell and Microsoft systems, wheras RemoteExecute allows to create workflows that span across different systems (Linux, Mac OS X and Windows) and accross scripting languages (PowerShell, Bash, etc.) 

RemoteExecute is writing in C# and requires a Windows Server to host the application, but for the rest is OS independent and configurable through a web interface and a REST API.
